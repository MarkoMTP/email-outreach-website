              I'm <strong>Marko MatkoviÄ‡</strong>, software developer and marketing expert. I first built Email Outreach Engineâ„¢ for my own agency, <strong>Alta Frequenza Marketing</strong>, to automate our lead generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as an internal tool became a complete game-changer â€” turning manual prospecting into a predictable, automated system that contacts thousands of qualified leads every month and keeps our inbox organized like never before.
            </p>
            <p>
              After seeing the results, I started offering this system to other B2B companies that want to scale without hiring SDRs or spending hours on LinkedIn.
